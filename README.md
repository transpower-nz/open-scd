# SCL editor

The SCL editor is a light weight editor for substation configuration language as defined in the IEC 61850-6. This editor is been created with a focus on a general user that does want to be close to the process described in the standard and an easy to maintain distribution (for long term stability).

Give it a try on https://openenergytools.github.io/scl-editor

# Scope:

It is not the goal to reach every user of SCL, nor is it the goal to support all history of the standard. Out of scope is for example:

- Edition 1 of the IEC 61850-6
- Support of multi-edition projects

!!This distribution is in development and must be used with care!!
